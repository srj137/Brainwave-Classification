# Brainwave-Classification
This repo provides two Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) based on VGG architecture to achieve end-to-end brainwave classification. Simple 1D CNN directly accepts processed brainwave while for more elaborate 2D CNN brainwave is first passed through a filter-bank of 16 filters to create a 2D image. The experiments are performed using synthesized Local Field Potential(LFP) brainwave data with different noise levels. The networks achieve an accuracy of 75.19% and 76.03% resp. for a dataset with -11.94dB average SNR.
