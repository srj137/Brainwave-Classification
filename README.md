# Brainwave-Classification
Classification of brainwaves in recordings is of considerable interest to neuroscience and medical communities. Classification techniques used presently depend on the extraction of low-level features from the recordings, which in turn affects the classification performance. To alleviate this problem, this study proposes an end-to-end approach using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which has been shown to detect complex patterns in a signal by exploiting its spatiotemporal nature. The study uses time and frequency axes for the classification using synthesized Local Field Potential (LFP) data. The results are analyzed and compared with the FFT technique.
